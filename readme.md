## Requirements
This mod is made for the [Unreal Engine 4/5 Scripting System](https://docs.ue4ss.com/#basic-installation) and was tested with the Steam version of Palworld. Download and extract the xinput version to `/Palworld/Pal/Binaries/Win64/` (as described in their documentation) to get started. 

## Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cxve/Palworld-Mod-Toggle-HUD/releases/download/Release/ToggleHUDMod.zip) of the mod and extract it to `/Palworld/Pal/Binaries/Win64/Mods/`.

## Usage
Press `F9` while in-game to toggle the HUD. Please note that some game functionality is unavailable while the HUD is hidden.

You can change the toggle key in the `main.lua` file.
